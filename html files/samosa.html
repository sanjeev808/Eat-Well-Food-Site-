    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making The Stuffing </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step to homemade samosa is to cook the potatoes and peas for the filling.</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>To cook the potatoes and peas in a stovetop pressure cooker: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker. On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame.</li>
            <li>If using an Instant Pot: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Add 2 cups water. Place a trivet on top of the potatoes, and on top of the trivet set a bowl with ½ cup of green peas. Pressure cook on high for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker. For the Instant Pot, do a quick pressure release after 5 to 7 minutes. Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are cooked well.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The knife or fork should be able to slide through easily if the potatoes are cooked properly.</li>
            <li>If the potatoes are undercooked, then cook them for a few more minutes using the pressure cook function. Once done, drain the potatoes and peas in a colander and set aside to cool.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Next, toast the spices. This will help to release their flavors and should not be skipped!</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>To a small frying pan over low heat add ½ inch cinnamon stick, 1 clove (optional), 1 green cardamom, 3 black peppercorns, ½ teaspoon cumin seeds, ½ teaspoon fennel seeds and 2 teaspoon coriander seeds.</li>
            <li>Heat the spices for just a few minutes until aromatic, being careful to not burn.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Then, put them in a spice grinder or small mixer-grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Grind the toasted spices to a semi-fine powder, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Peel the skin off of the cooked potatoes, and chop them in ½ to 1 inch cubes.</li>
        <li>In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil and crackle ½ teaspoon cumin seeds until fragrant. I used mustard oil as it really adds a punch in the stuffing. You can use a neutral oil like sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil or canola oil.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat on low and add 1 teaspoon finely chopped or minced ginger and 2 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.</li>
        <li>Now you can switch off the flame or keep flame to a low. Then add the cooked green peas, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing), the dry ground spice mix that we made and 1 to 2 teaspoons dry mango powder (amchur)
        </li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>The mango powder is what gives the samosa filling its signature tangy flavor that balances so well with the savory, spicy flavors of the other stuffing ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Stir together and sauté for a minute. You can add less or more dry mango powder depending upon personal taste. I added 2 teaspoons as just 1 teaspoon was not quite enough sour flavor for me.</li>
        <li>Next add potato cubes, salt as required and 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (also known as cilantro) to the skillet.</li>

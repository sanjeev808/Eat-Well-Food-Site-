<h2> Ingredients</h2>

    <li>3 to 4 tablespoons butter unsalted, softened and as needed</li>
    <li>1 cup grated cheddar cheese or a mix of cheddar or mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>▢½ to 1 teaspoon red chilli flakes – optional</li>
    <li>½ to 1 teaspoon crushed black pepper</li>
    <li>▢1 tablespoon chopped basil – fresh, swap for 1 teaspoon dried basil instead</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped celery – optional</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt or as required</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Panini Press Sandwich</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 to 10 slices bread (preferred choice of soft bread)</li>
    <li>3 to 4 tablespoons salted butter – softened or as needed</li>
    <li>1 cup grated cheddar cheese or as required</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon crushed black pepper or as required</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder or as required</li>
    <li>1 to 2 teaspoons chaat masala or sandwich masala, add as required</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> First, slice your bread loaf in ½ inches slices. You want about 8 to 10 slices total, depending on how many cheese sandwiches you are making. Here I have used homemade Whole Wheat Bread.</li>
    <li>Spread softened butter on the slices of bread</li>
    <li>op half of the slices with 3 to 4 tablespoons or more (depending on the size of the bread slices) of freshly grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese, or a mix of both. For 8 to 10 slices you will need a total of about 1 cup of grated cheese.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with a pinch or two of various dried herbs, red chilli flakes and crushed black pepper. Here I’ve used parsley, thyme and oregano with bits of chilli pepper flakes. Feel free to add your favorite herbs.</li>
    <li>For a bit of an elevated grilled cheese sandwich, top the cheese lightly with some chopped fresh basil and finely chopped celery. You can use dried basil in place of fresh basil.Sprinkle with one to pinches of salt (to taste) evenly all over. If you don’t have fresh celery you can swap with celery salt, and omit the salt</li>
    <li>Cover the cheese topped bread with the buttered slice.</li>
    <li>Heat a heavy or a thick bottomed skillet, or a frying pan, on low to medium-low heat on the stovetop. Spread some butter in the skillet, and allow it to melt. Then place the cheese sandwich in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Spread some more softened butter on top of the bread.</li>
    <li>Gently press the sandwich with a spatula so that you can get nice, evenly toasted and crispy texture. You can even place a heavy object, like a clean plate, on the sandwich.</li>
